# Moby Art Store Demo Application

## Current build and run (this will be improved)
```bash
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/mobyartshop -w /mobyartshop maven:alpine mvn package -DskipTests
cp -f target/mobyartshop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app/
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

(Unfortunately the above will most likely not work on Linux due to root bind
mount, you will need to get craftier with user remapping if executing there)

## The demo application is a store application with the following features:

* user account creation and sign-in 
* a products page listing all available products
* a detail page for an individual products
* a shopping cart to add products
* an order page that displays the products in the cart and a total

A page for each feature will be needed in the client.

## The application architecture includes:

* microservices REST backend written in Java and spring-boot to handle the store functions
* PostgreSQL database for product inventory, customer data, and order data
* Nginx proxies for serving static data and handling HTTPS request
* store front client written in Angular

## Front end is adopted from [ngCart](http://ngcart.snapjay.com/) and currently has a wireframe interface, not connected to the actual app.

## The operational architecture features:

### Swarm features supported and highlighted:
* Secrets
* Routing mesh
* Overlay networks
* Dynamic storage (infinit.io)
* Can run as a single stateless container
* Can be deployed as multi-container stateful app through compose v3 (docker stack deploy)
* Can be deployed on Docker 4 Mac for development demo
* Message queue
* Optimize for startup time

### UCP features supported and highlighted:
* L7 loadbalancing (HRM)
* HRM sticky sessions
* HRM HTTPS (SNI)

### Other ideas:
* Jmeter load generation
* NFS store for static content

## Configuration

### Static content
Make a directory for static content called 'static' in the same directory as the appication (MobyArtShop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar)

```
Application
|- MobyArtShop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
|- static/
   |- client files
   |- images
   |_ ...

```

the URL for the content is http://localhost:8080/mobyartshop/*
